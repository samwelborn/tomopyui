:::{note}

This is a tutorial as of v0.0.2. Some of these features may have been upgraded since these were recorded, but they should give you a general sense of what to do.

:::
## Opening Jupyter Lab

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/intro.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Importing Data

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/import.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Finding Center of Rotation

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/center.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Alignment (tomopy without CUDA)

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/alignment.mp4", autoplay=False)
```


This alignment creates subfolders with metadata:

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/subdirs.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Exploring aligned data

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/data_explorer.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Reconstruction

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/recon.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Exploring reconstructed data

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/recon_data_explorer.mp4", autoplay=False)
```

## Loading in metadata

```{jupyter-execute}
:hide-code:

from ipywidgets import Video, HBox, Layout
Video.from_file("_static/videos/load_metadata.mp4", autoplay=False)
```
