abstract = {The management and processing of synchrotron and neutron computed tomography data can be a complex, labor-intensive and unstructured process. Users devote substantial time to both manually processing their data ({\it i.e.} organizing data/metadata, applying image filters {\it etc.}) and waiting for the computation of iterative alignment and reconstruction algorithms to finish. In this work, we present a solution to these problems: {\it TomoPyUI}, a user interface for the well known tomography data processing package {\it TomoPy}. This highly visual Python software package guides the user through the tomography processing pipeline from data import, preprocessing, alignment and finally to 3D volume reconstruction. The {\it TomoPyUI} systematic intermediate data and metadata storage system improves organization, and the inspection and manipulation tools (built within the application) help to avoid interrupted workflows. Notably, {\it TomoPyUI} operates entirely within a {\it Jupyter} environment. Herein, we provide a summary of these key features of {\it TomoPyUI}, along with an overview of the tomography processing pipeline, a discussion of the landscape of existing tomography processing software and the purpose of {\it TomoPyUI}, and a demonstration of its capabilities for real tomography data collected at SSRL beamline 6-2c.},
